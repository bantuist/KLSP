Victor and Caleb need your financial support to be able to attend school. The brothers are being raised by a single mother in the rural community of Kalawa, Kenya.

Schools in Kenya are in session for three terms per year. School fees are paid per term by parents or guardians. In addition to tuition feels school uniforms need to be purchased and are required in order to attend school.
Victor and Caleb attend St. Joseph’s Academy, Kalawa, Kenya; a school supported by the non-profit organization:  Kalawa Library and School Project.

School fees for one child at St. Joseph Academy are 7,000 shillings ($70) per term and 21,000 shillings ($210) per school year.

Victor and Caleb together require 14,000 shillings ($140) per term and 42,000 shillings ($420) per school year.
Victor’s and Caleb’s mother is able to afford 1,500 shillings ($15) per child per term and 4,500 shillings ($45) per school year. She has also managed to provide uniforms for her boys.
