While visiting rural Kalawa, Kenya, one is struck by the bleak living conditions of the people in contrast to the beauty and allure of Africa. Mud, thatched homes, crude outhouses (many homes without a out house), no electricity, compromised water sources . . . all speak to the glaring poverty of people with limited resources, limited employment, limited healthcare, and limited education.

At the Kalawa Market young people are everywhere; standing about, talking, . . . hoping, waiting with a longing in their eyes for something to do: to see who gets off a small public transport bus that has just arrived from the capital city, Nairobi. Perhaps someone they know will alight; someone who has news, someone who may be able to buy them a cup of tea; or, for the hope of getting leads for employment. Many have all but given up looking for work and resigned themselves to being dependent upon the kindness of their relatives and other people for support.

The squalor of the market place’s unpaved streets littered with sugar cane fibers; banana leaves; peels and rinds from fruits; corn cobs and husks; and plastic bags and paper confront one’s senses. This is a scene that strikes me every time I return home for a visit since first living in the US in the early 1970’s. With the burgeoning population of recent years, these conditions are now rampant.

Two observations that continue to strike me each time I return to Kenya to visit are: how eager young people are to obtain an education and the extreme lack of educational resources available. Young people want to talk with me and ask me questions about education in the US; if a sponsor can be found, if they can travel and go to school in America.

At such times, I have wondered if resources could be available, if these students could have a school library, full of books . . . they could and would devour books . . . devour learning . . . and lift themselves up from poverty to prosperity . . . or, at the very least, to a more successful and fulfilling life. Every time I visit my village I wonder what I can do to help improve the situation.

As a career educator since the mid 1970’s, I purport that education plays a vital part in any solution toward improving the lives of a rural village. I think if people have the opportunity for a good education, they can learn how to find or create resources wherever they live.

In September 30, 2011, I registered Kalawa Library and School Project, as a non-profit organization in South Dakota. My idea was and is to raise funds to build a library and later a K-8 elementary school.

In October 2011, I was determined to start a library. I felt strongly that if there was a library in Kalawa, it would be a good start toward doing something that could improve the community. The community could have reading materials and subsequently discover ideas that would transform their lives. I thought the library could be used as a place where community members would meet, hold forums, where they could discuss community issues, concerns and solutions.

I felt that by starting with the library the community would benefit as a whole. This would create the desire for an elementary school. Since many students don’t go on to high school . . . my thinking was that by offering a good elementary education with career exploration and skill development in the upper grades, it would provide a chance for the youth to change the trajectory of their lives and that of their community.

October of 2011, I shipped a few books and traveled to Kenya. We refurbished a farm storage building, making it into a library. We invited youngsters to spend a couple of days learning about the library and reading books. Students were excited to know that they could take a book that they liked home with them for a few days to read at leisure. The library officially opened on December 16, 2011. Paula, Nancy Herrick, and I continue to collect library books in the US to ship to Kenya to continue developing the first community library in the village of Kalawa, Makueni, Kenya.

In addition to the library project, the second part of this project, St. Joseph Academy, a Demonstration School was my dream. The same month the library opened, a couple of parents approached me and expressed their great need for a school. January, 2012, St Joseph Academy was established and Pre-K-2 classes were begun. Today we have a Pre-K-6 school with 32 students.
